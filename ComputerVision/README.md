This repository provides the latest sample code for Cognitive Services Computer Vision SDK quickstarts. These samples target the [Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.ComputerVision 3.2.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.ComputerVision/3.2.0) client library.

## Features

These samples demonstrate how to use the Computer Vision client library for C# to perform the following actions:
